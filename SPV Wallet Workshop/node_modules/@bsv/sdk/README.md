# BSV SDK

BSV BLOCKCHAIN | Software Development Kit for JavaScript and TypeScript

Welcome to the BSV Blockchain Libraries Project, the comprehensive TypeScript SDK designed to provide an updated and unified layer for developing scalable applications on the BSV Blockchain. This SDK addresses the limitations of previous tools by offering a fresh, peer-to-peer approach, adhering to SPV, and ensuring privacy and scalability.

## Objective

The BSV Blockchain Libraries Project aims to structure and maintain a middleware layer of the BSV Blockchain technology stack. By facilitating the development and maintenance of core libraries, it serves as an essential toolkit for developers looking to build on the BSV Blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the SDK, run:

```bash
npm install @bsv/sdk
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of using the SDK to create and sign a transaction:

```javascript
import { PrivateKey, P2PKH, Transaction, ARC } from '@bsv/sdk'

const privKey = PrivateKey.fromWif('L5EY1SbTvvPNSdCYQe1EJHfXCBBT4PmnF6CDbzCm9iifZptUvDGB')

const sourceTransaction = Transaction.fromHex('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')

const version = 1
const input = {
  sourceTransaction,
  sourceOutputIndex: 0,
  unlockingScriptTemplate: new P2PKH().unlock(privKey),
}
const output = {
  lockingScript: new P2PKH().lock(privKey.toPublicKey().toHash()),
  change: true
}

const tx = new Transaction(version, [input], [output])
await tx.fee()
await tx.sign()

await tx.broadcast()
```
